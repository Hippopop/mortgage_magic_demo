/// NOTE:
/// First of all, thank you so much for this opportunity.
/// It was fun doing this small project, totally focused on UI.
/// It would have much much simpler and easier If I could export
/// the Figma contents as images. Which wasn't possible because
/// I didn't have edit access to the Figma file. I requested
/// the access. But then I decided to do it the hard way.
/// And to be honest, it was more fun the hard way.
/// 
/// 
/// I just wanted to mention it. Out of all the
/// criteria, code structure, and making it pixel-perfect is
/// what stood out to me. And I did my best to make it pixel-perfect
/// with the Figma design. And the coding structure, I think that's a
/// bit more preference-based. In my opinion at least.
/// And lastly, I wanted to thank you for giving me long enough time for 
/// the project. Cause I was on a family vacation since, February first.
/// And it will end on February 6th. Which is today. So I had the time to
/// work on this partially too. So thanks a lot for that.
/// 
/// That's all from me. Thank you so much. I wish you a great day.
/// And I hope to hear back from Mortgage Magic soon again. Also, if you have
/// the time, please help me improve by pointing out any mistakes or doing any
/// constructive criticism. It will be much appreciated.
/// ~ Mostafijul Islam.
